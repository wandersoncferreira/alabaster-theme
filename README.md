# Emacs implementation of Alabaster Theme


I am slowly crafting my own version of Alabaster theme originally written by [@tonsky](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster).

I am using light themes for a while now and got very used to them, the idea behind Alabaster is very
interesting and aligned with my standards and what I think a non-distracting environment should look
like.


Warning: Work in Progress.
